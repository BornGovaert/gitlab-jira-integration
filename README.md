If you are using *GitLab Community Edition* and you want to fully integrate gitlab with JIRA (ie. comment issues), you can use this project. It's a standalone java service which provides endpoints to intercepts hook events from gitlab and use JIRA REST api to interacts with issues.

Requirements
============

* A JVM (jdk 8)
* An account on JIRA which can comment issues on projects
* An account on gitlab to have a private_token (admin rights are not required)

How to use
==========

* Download the fatjar **gitlab-jira-integration-application** from maven central
* Create a yaml file as follow and configure it

```yaml

server:
  applicationConnectors:
    - type: http
      port: 9090

  adminConnectors:
    - type: http
      port: 9091

logging:
  appenders:
    - type: console
      logFormat: "%-5p [%d{ISO8601,UTC}] [%thread] [%c{5}] %m%n%rEx"
      
password: test-password

jira:
  username: gitlab
  password: gitlab
  url: http://localhost:8090

gitlab:
  private_token: N1bJ4n8-rbFAEf8Syrh2
  url: http://192.168.59.104:8080
  
```

* Launch your JAR like this : ```java -jar gitlab-jira-integration-application.jar server properties.yml```

If everything is ok you should have something like this in your console :

```
INFO  [2015-10-10 17:48:43,361] [main] [i.d.j.DropwizardResourceConfig] [hookId:-] : The following paths were found for the configured resources:

    POST    /hook (fr.mmarie.resources.HookResource)

INFO  [2015-10-10 17:48:43,365] [main] [o.e.j.s.h.ContextHandler] [hookId:-] : Started i.d.j.MutableServletContextHandler@43a0a32d{/,null,AVAILABLE}

    POST    /tasks/gc (io.dropwizard.servlets.tasks.GarbageCollectionTask)

INFO  [2015-10-10 17:48:43,376] [main] [o.e.j.s.h.ContextHandler] [hookId:-] : Started i.d.j.MutableServletContextHandler@5aaaa446{/,null,AVAILABLE}
INFO  [2015-10-10 17:48:43,394] [main] [o.e.j.s.ServerConnector] [hookId:-] : Started application@794b435f{HTTP/1.1}{0.0.0.0:9090}
INFO  [2015-10-10 17:48:43,398] [main] [o.e.j.s.ServerConnector] [hookId:-] : Started admin@38f2e97e{HTTP/1.1}{0.0.0.0:9091}
INFO  [2015-10-10 17:48:43,399] [main] [o.e.j.s.Server] [hookId:-] : Started @3812ms
```

You need to generate a token to authenticate your hook, format of the token is :
[service:pwd] encoded in Base64, where service is any value you want to identify your gitlab hook, and password is the one defined in the YAML configuration file.

* Add a new WebHook service in gitlab settings to : ```http://[IP/HOSTNAME]:9090/hook?token=[see above]```

* Commit messages with a JIRA issue prefixed by **#** will be mentionnd in issue comments. (For example : **#TESTGIT-1**)

Transitions
===========

Since version **0.5.0** it's possible to perfom transition on JIRA issues (ie Close, Fix...) :

To do that, you need to add this part to your configuration :

``` yaml
jira:
  # Username, pwd...
  transitions:
    - name: Closed
      # Case insensitive
      keywords:
        - closed
        - closes
        - close
        - fixed
        - fixes
        - fix
```

Example of commit messages working with previous configuration :

`` Test Closes #TESGITLAB-3 ``

`` Hello World FIX #TESGITLAB-15 `` 

This message will close both issues :

`` Hello World FIX #TESGITLAB-25 and Close #TESGITLAB-47 ``

To edit your transitions in JIRA, take a look at the [jira documentation](https://confluence.atlassian.com/jira/configuring-workflow-185729632.html)

The change will be also commented in the jira issue activity to notify in which commit the issue has been closed (or any other transition)

*Note :* The default resolution will be taken, it only manage **transition**
